    <h1>How To Make Your Diet Healthy</h1>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>
            <h2>Base your meals on higher fibre starchy carbohydrates</h2>
        </li>
        <p>Starchy carbohydrates should make up just over a third of the food you eat. They include potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and cereals.</p>

        <p>Choose higher fibre or wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or potatoes with their skins on.</p>

        <p>Contain more fibre than white or refined starchy carbohydrates and can help you feel full for longer.</p>
        <li>
            <h2> Eat lots of fruit and veg</h2>
        </li>
        <p>It's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and veg every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced.</p>
        <p>A portion of fresh, canned or frozen fruit and vegetables is 80g. A portion of dried fruit (which should be kept to mealtimes) is 30g.</p>
        <p>A 150ml glass of fruit juice, vegetable juice or smoothie also counts as 1 portion, but limit the amount you have to no more than 1 glass a day as these drinks are sugary and can damage your teeth.</p>
        <li>
            <h2>Eat more fish, including a portion of oily fish</h2>
        </li>
        <p>Fish is a good source of protein and contains many vitamins and minerals.</p>

        <p>Aim to eat at least 2 portions of fish a week, including at least 1 portion of oily fish.</p>
        <p>Oily fish are high in omega-3 fats, which may help prevent heart disease. </p>
        <p>Oily fish include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>salmon</li>
            <li>trout</li>
            <li>herring</li>
            <li>sardines</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Non-oily fish include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>haddock</li>
            <li>plaice</li>
            <li>coley</li>
            <li>tuna</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Cut down on saturated fat and sugar</h2>
        </li>
        <h4>Saturated fat</h4>
        <p>You need some fat in your diet, but it's important to pay attention to the amount and type of fat you're eating.</p>
        <p>There are 2 main types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. Too much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of developing heart disease.</p>
        <p>On average, men should have no more than 30g of saturated fat a day. On average, women should have no more than 20g of saturated fat a day.</p>
        <h4>Sugar</h4>
        <p>Regularly consuming foods and drinks high in sugar increases your risk of obesity and tooth decay.</p>
        <p>Sugary foods and drinks are often high in energy (measured in kilojoules or calories), and if consumed too often can contribute to weight gain. They can also cause tooth decay, especially if eaten between meals.</p>
        <p>Free sugars are any sugars added to foods or drinks, or found naturally in honey, syrups and unsweetened fruit juices and smoothies. This is the type of sugar you should be cutting down on, rather than the sugar found in fruit and milk.</p>
        <li>
            <h2>Eat less salt: no more than 6g a day for adults</h2>
        </li>
        <p>Eating too much salt can raise your blood pressure. People with high blood pressure are more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke.</p>
        <p>Even if you do not add salt to your food, you may still be eating too much. About three-quarters of the salt you eat is already in the food when you buy it, such as breakfast cereals, soups, breads and sauces.</p>
        <p>Adults and children aged 11 and over should eat no more than 6g of salt (about a teaspoonful) a day. Younger children should have even less.</p>
