        <p>Breakfast is often called ‘the most important meal of the day’, and for good reason. As the name suggests, breakfast breaks the overnight fasting period. It replenishes your supply of glucose to boost your energy levels and alertness, while also
            providing other essential nutrients required for good health.</p>
        <p>Many studies have shown the health benefits of eating breakfast. It improves your energy levels and ability to concentrate in the short term, and can help with better weight management, reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease in the
            long term.</p>
        <h2>Why breakfast is so important</h2>
        <p>When you wake up from your overnight sleep, you may not have eaten for up to 10 hours. Breakfast replenishes the stores of energy and nutrients in your body.</p>
        <h3>Energy</h3>
        <p>The body’s energy source is glucose. Glucose is broken down and absorbed from the carbohydrates you eat. The body stores most of its energy as fat. But your body also stores some glucose as glycogen, most of it in your liver, with smaller amounts
            in your muscles. </p>
        <p>Eating breakfast boosts your energy levels and restores your glycogen levels ready to keep your metabolism up for the day.</p>
        <h3>Essential vitamins, minerals and nutrients</h3>
        <p>Breakfast foods are rich in key nutrients such as folate, calcium, iron, B vitamins and fibre. Breakfast provides a lot of your day’s total nutrient intake. In fact, people who eat breakfast are more likely to meet their recommended daily intakes
            of vitamins and minerals than people who don’t.
        </p>
        <h3>Breakfast helps you control your weight</h3>
        <p>People who regularly eat breakfast are less likely to be overweight or obese. Research is ongoing as to why this is the case. It is thought that eating breakfast may help you control your weight because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>it prevents large fluctuations in your blood glucose levels, helping you to control your appetite</li>
            <li>breakfast fills you up before you become really hungry, so you’re less likely to just grab whatever foods are nearby when hunger really strikes (for example high energy, high fat foods with added sugars or salt).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Breakfast boosts brainpower</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have breakfast, you might find you feel a bit sluggish and struggle to focus on things. This is because your brain hasn’t received the energy (glucose) it needs to get going. Studies suggest that not having breakfast affects your
            mental performance, including your attention, ability to concentrate and memory. This can make some tasks feel harder than they normally would.</p>
        <p>Children and adolescents who regularly eat breakfast also tend to perform better academically compared with those who skip breakfast. They also feel a greater level of connectedness with teachers and other adults at their school, which leads to
            further positive health and academic outcomes.</p>
