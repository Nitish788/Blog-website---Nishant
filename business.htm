    <h1>Tips to Keep Your Salespeople Happy</h1>

        <li>
            <h2>Focus on key sales activities instead of result</h2>
        </li>
        <p>
            Focusing on sales results alone can be stressful, especially considering that as a salesperson or sales manager, you can influence yet never control results.</p>
        <p>You can control the inputs that have the highest positive effects on achieving your goals — your activities. For instance, you can control whether or not you make a sales call, and you can control what percentage you talk compared to listen on
            that call, yet the prospect’s decision to buy or say goodbye is entirely up to him or her.
        </p>
        <li>
            <h2>Public displays of appreciation</h2>
        </li>
        <p>An important determinant for happiness on the job is whether you feel appreciated for your work</p>
        <p><strong>Sales Tips:</strong>Some quick suggestions to let your sales staff know you care about them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Don’t just celebrate big milestones, celebrate the small ones, too.</li>
            <li>Give specific compliments</li>
            <li>Tell employees you trust them, then back your words up by showing employees you trust them.</li>
            <li>Every month have an “appreciation day” for a standout employee who doesn't necessarily have that month’s best sales</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Set a destination, not a path</h2>
        </li>
        <p> One way to do this is to “set a destination” (the goal itself) for your salespeople but trust them to “find the path” (to decide what work needs to be done to achieve the goal).</p>
        <li>
            <h2>Blur the line between boss and employee</h2>
        </li>
        <p>If you’re the manager of a sales team, what responsibilities can you delegate? Another way to look at this is: What tasks can you move off your plate that will motivate your team members grow?</p>
        <li>
            <h2> Question efficiency if it’s not linked to meaning</h2>
        </li>
        <p>Yet such routinization and division of labor comes with the unwanted human cost of employees deriving less satisfaction from their work. It’s an often unrecognized trade-off: the goals of efficiency — and ultimately greater profits — come at the
            price of decreased employee happiness</p>
        <p><strong>Sales Motivation Tip:</strong> Be on the lookout for monotonous, routinized work. If you identify it, do your best to make it meaningful, challenging and engaging.</p>
