    <h2>Nature -precious gift of god in heaven</h2>
    <p>Nature is said to be one of the precious and best gift given by god to us. We people are really blessed to have such kinda things that surrounds us. Earth consists of many natural scenes that are really awesome. Earth is mostly covered with greenery
        nature. Nature is likely to be our best friend that provides us all the resources to live on earth. Means It gives us water to drink, pure air to breathe, food to eat, land to stay, animals, plants for other uses etc.. for our betterment. We should
        enjoy the nature without disturbing its ecological balance. We should care our precious nature, make it peaceful, keep it clean and prevent it from the destruction. Nature is a most precious gift given by the God to us to enjoy but not to harm.</p>
    <p>But, when we talk about nature and when we utter that it is a precious gift from god to us, Then a important question a raises here. That is "Do people think to preserve nature?" This question is a raised because nowadays we aren't much cautious about
        nature and it's beauties. Infact, the ecological balance had been broken by humans, but just now we can see the results of the deforestation, global warming and extinction. We people do only things that are against to nature. Means that we use
        to cut trees in large scale for our own purpose. Well! ok it's fine to cut but we fail to plant a tree instead of the dead one. And we also use plastics that are harmful for the nature. We use to burn things and pave a way for global warming etc.</p>
    <p> Each and every human being should plant at least one sapling in his/her lifetime. Trees enhance the landscape and provide valuable and sometimes unique habitats for flora and fauna. They provide us pure air, prevent soil erosion. Also they provide
        us with a vital renewable material that is timber. When we cut trees and plant one more sapling in place of that cut tree we some what balance the ecosystem. A single tree is a sustainable source of fuel, food, animal and birds habitats and timber
        and at the same time absorb much of carbon dioxide . A country's wealth and climate are determined on the basis of its natural resources. Good agricultural yield helps in making the people well fed and healthy. Each one of us should decide to
        give plant saplings as gift during festive occasions.</p>
    <p>Nature is like our real mother which never harms us instead always nourishes us. Walking in the lap of nature in the early morning makes us healthy and strong as well as keeps us away from diseases like diabetes, chronic heart diseases, high blood
        pressure, liver problem, digestive system ailments, infections, brain disease, etc. Most of the poets, writers and people used to of yoga and meditation are seen in the early morning in the garden to re-energize their body, mind and soul.</p>
    <p>Nature is the beautiful creation of the God which he blessed to us as a precious gift. So we should not destroy the originality of the nature and should not imbalance the ecosystem cycle. Because, The nature has everything for us but we do not have
        anything for it even we are destroying its property day by day to just fulfill our selfish wishes. We knlw that our precious nature provides us beautiful environment to live and enjoy our life time. So it is our responsibility to keep it clean
        it and keep them away from all the damages. In the modern technology, many selfish and bad activities of the human being have disturbed the nature to a great extent. And this modern technological world there are lots of inventions that are getting
        launched daily without its advantage and disadvantage to the nature. It is our responsibility to save the declining assets of our nature to make possible the existence of life forever on the earth. If we do not take any step towards nature conservation,
        we are keeping our future generations at danger. We should understood its worth and value and try to maintain its natural shape and try to maintain our nature’s beauty.</p>
