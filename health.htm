    <h1>5 Ways to Add Yoga to Your Daily Life</h1>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>
            <h2>Get a Discipline</h2>
        </li>
        <p>There can be no practice of any kind — yoga, exercise, or meditation — till we create time for it in our lives. Herein lies the power of routine — a structure that clearly allocates time for different activities in the day.</p>
        <li>
            <h2>Be Grateful</h2>
        </li>
        <p>A feeling of contentment in our lives primarily originates from a feeling of gratitude. Contentment is not just a hallmark of the yogic way of life, but also for every person who wishes to feel more joyful and fulfilled. </p>
        <p>While doing the course, at the end of each day, we reflected upon and wrote down a few points of gratitude for the happenings of the day. The end result: we felt blessed for what we had received — from a nice meal, to a pleasant encounter, to
            a good lecture or asana class!
        </p>
        <li>
            <h2>Stay Positive</h2>
        </li>
        <p>An important concept of yoga is to transform a negative thought into a positive one… In Sanskrit, it is called pratipaksha bhavana, the ability to become consciously aware of a negative thought, and quickly replace it with a positive one.</p>
        <p>Pratipaksha bhavana works on helping you seek a more uplifting and empowering alternative.</p>
        <li>
            <h2>Breathe Consciously</h2>
        </li>
        <p>We take our breath for granted, and almost forget about it, as we get engrossed in living and working… But your breath is your life force, without which nothing would be possible.</p>
        <p>Breathing exercises, or pranayama, is thus at the centre of yoga… Just by mere observation, and breath awareness, you can control the functioning of your mind and body, and create a state of calm and equilibrium.</p>
        <p>The breath and its patterns, also help you attain a deep and uninterrupted meditative state — the ultimate goal of yoga</p>
        <li>
            <h2>Learn to Relax</h2>
        </li>
        <p>Relaxation is highly underrated, but immensely beneficial. Yoga puts great emphasis on relaxation at the end of very strenuous activities. No asana practice should end without a few minutes of relaxation.</p>
        <p>The classical shavasana, or ‘corpse pose’, where you lie down completely still — like a corpse — with feet and hands apart, can help you achieve a relaxed state.
        </p>
        <p>Likewise, try to incorporate short spells of relaxation throughout the day. Just 10–15 minutes of sitting or lying down, in complete silence and stillness, can help calm your mind and body. Relaxation of this kind can be done anywhere and has
            similar benefits of a power nap.</p>
